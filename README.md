## Sparkle 
Sparkle is a decentralized token created on the ethereum network. Sparkle allows a peer to peer computing on a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks or workloads between peers. We understand that with blockchain has a limited number of consumer based products that the community can spend their assets on. There are a variety of reasons for this, but it is mainly merchants who suffer from the lack of underlying architecture to sell goods at a set rate. Sparkleâ€™s prime utility connects the dots between non-monetary items (digital currencies) and automotive-related services (physical product). The value of sparkle lies in the delivery of a service, and its ability to remove market volatility from existing services offered. Sparkle KYC verification serves an important role in verifying the authentication of SPARKLE customers. SPARKLE token is not the only utility being offered, but the ultimate goal is to provide data security and safe access to sparkle resources.
